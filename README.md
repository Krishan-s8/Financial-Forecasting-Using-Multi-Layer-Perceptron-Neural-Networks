# Exchange Rate Prediction using Neural Networks üíπ

This repository contains an **R-based machine learning pipeline** to forecast USD/EUR exchange rates using **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks**.

## ‚ú® Features

* Data preparation with lagged features for time series forecasting
* Min-max normalization and unnormalization for interpretability
* Training multiple MLP models with different input combinations, hidden layers, and activation functions
* Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE
* Visualization of predicted vs. actual exchange rates for clear performance comparison

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Import:** Load exchange rate data from Excel using `readxl`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering:** Generate lagged datasets (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-4) for forecasting.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Normalization:** Apply min-max normalization for neural network stability.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training:** Train 14 different MLP models using `neuralnet` with various architectures and activation functions.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluation:** Use RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE metrics for comparison.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Prediction and Visualization:** Generate and visualize predictions against actual exchange rates.

## üìä Results

* Displays predictions from all trained models
* Prints RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE for clear model comparison
* Visualization of predicted vs. actual exchange rates for the best-performing model

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used

* `readxl`, `neuralnet`, `dplyr`, `MLmetrics`, `Metrics`
